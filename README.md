# PynamicDNS
Cloudflare Dynamic DNS - Built in Python

---

## Usage
Using this is relatively simple, I think. The configuration is [YAML](http://yaml.org/).

Simply plop your Cloudflare email, API key, zone IDs and hostnames into their place within the config and fire up pynamicdns.py. That's it. Nothing else to do.

Make sure you rename pynamic.example.yml to pynamic.yml, by the way. :-)
